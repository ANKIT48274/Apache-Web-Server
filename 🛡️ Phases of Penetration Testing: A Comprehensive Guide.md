## 📖 Introduction

**Penetration Testing** (or Ethical Hacking) is a structured and authorized process used to test the security of systems, networks, and applications. This guide breaks down the **seven key phases** of a penetration test, explaining their objectives, activities, and common tools used by security professionals.

## 🧭 Penetration Testing Lifecycle

### 🔹 1. Planning and Scoping (Pre-engagement)

**🎯 Objective:** Define goals, scope, and rules of engagement for a legal and effective test.

**Key Activities:**

* Understand the client’s business objectives and security goals
* Define the scope (e.g., IPs, domains, APIs, apps)
* Set rules of engagement and timeframe
* Get written legal authorization

---

### 🔹 2. Reconnaissance (Information Gathering)

**🎯 Objective:** Collect intelligence about the target to identify potential attack surfaces.

**Passive Recon:**

* WHOIS, DNS lookups, public breach records
* Metadata scraping with FOCA
* Social media research

**Active Recon:**

* Port scanning (Nmap), service fingerprinting
* Banner grabbing, Netcat, Shodan queries

---

### 🔹 3. Vulnerability Analysis

**🎯 Objective:** Identify and prioritize security weaknesses.

**Key Activities:**

* Run scanners (Nessus, OpenVAS, Qualys)
* Detect misconfigurations, outdated software, weak credentials
* Assign severity using CVSS & CVE IDs

---

### 🔹 4. Exploitation

**🎯 Objective:** Exploit identified vulnerabilities to gain access.

**Key Activities:**

* SQL injection, XSS, buffer overflows
* Use Metasploit, Burp Suite, SQLMap
* Privilege escalation
* Bypass firewalls and authentication

---

### 🔹 5. Post-Exploitation

**🎯 Objective:** Assess the level of access and potential damage.

**Key Activities:**

* Establish persistence (backdoors, scheduled tasks)
* Lateral movement (pivoting)
* Dump credentials (e.g., Mimikatz)
* Evaluate CIA triad (confidentiality, integrity, availability)

---

### 🔹 6. Reporting

**🎯 Objective:** Clearly document findings and provide remediation guidance.

**Key Deliverables:**

* Technical report with exploited vulnerabilities
* Screenshots, logs, PoCs
* Executive summary (non-technical)
* Fix recommendations: patches, config changes, best practices

---

### 🔹 7. Remediation Verification (Retesting)

**🎯 Objective:** Confirm that vulnerabilities are resolved.

**Key Activities:**

* Re-test systems after fixes
* Validate that patches/config changes are correctly applied
* Ensure no new issues were introduced

## 🔁 Penetration Testing vs. Hacking Lifecycle

| Phase              | Hacker (Malicious)            | Pentester (Ethical)       |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Reconnaissance     | Passive/Active info gathering | ✅ Yes                     |
| Scanning           | Port/service discovery        | ✅ Yes                     |
| Exploitation       | Unauthorized entry            | ✅ With permission         |
| Maintaining Access | Backdoors, pivoting           | ✅ But only for assessment |
| Covering Tracks    | Delete logs, evade detection  | ❌ Not allowed ethically   |
| Reporting          | ❌ None                        | ✅ Documented in detail    |

## 🛠️ Common Tools by Phase

| Phase             | Tools Used                                     |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Reconnaissance    | `theHarvester`, `Shodan`, `Maltego`, `FOCA`    |
| Scanning          | `Nmap`, `Nikto`, `OpenVAS`, `Nessus`           |
| Exploitation      | `Metasploit`, `SQLMap`, `Burp Suite`           |
| Post-Exploitation | `Mimikatz`, `PowerView`, `BloodHound`          |
| Reporting         | `Dradis`, `Serpico`, `Markdown`, `PDF exports` |
